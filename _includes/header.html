				<p>I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering Division</a> at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a>.
				<b><i>My research leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and novel hardware (GPUs) to make database management systems (DBMSs) simpler and more efficient.</i></b>
				I obtained my PhD from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, fortunately advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/">Andy
                                Pavlo</a>.
				<!-- >My research interests lie in the <b><i>intersection of database management systems (DBMSs) and machine learning (ML)</i></b>,
				especially using ML/AI techniques to automate database administration/tuning to remove human impediments.
				I recently have also been working on using novel harware architectures (GPUs) to accelerate data analytics. -->
				My PhD research focused on the architecture design of
				autonomous DBMSs,
				implemented in a <a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage">
                                DBMS prototype</a> built from CMU.
				I worked on the Delta Lake/Lakehouse at <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a> before joining UMich.

				in Computer Science and Technology
				at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>,
